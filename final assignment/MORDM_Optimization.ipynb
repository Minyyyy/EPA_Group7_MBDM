    "This notebook contains the Multi-Scenario Multi-objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM) optimization process. First, the wort-case reference scenarios are identified. Second, the minimum and maximum values for the outcomes are estimated. Third, the previous are used to perform Multi-Scenario MORDM optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is concerned with the identification of the optimal values for an efficient and representative optimisation. The objective outcomes to be optimized aim to minimize the aggregated Expected Annual Damage, Dike Investment Costs, and Expected Number of Deaths. The other outcomes RfR Investment Costs and Evacuation Costs were not minimized because it is in the interest of the Environmental Interest group to consider policies in which RfR and Evacuation are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides looking for a policy that protects the interests of the client, it is also important to search for the most favourable and acceptable policy for other involved actors. In light of this, the MORDM framework can search for promising strategies using a a Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) in multiple reference scenarios (Kasprzyk et al.2013; Watson and Kasprzyk2017; Bartholomew and J. H. Kwakkel2020)."

This constraints look to meet the requirement set by the Delta Commission by which there cannot be more than 0.01\\% deaths per location and time stage.
